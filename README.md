# House-Grade-Prediction-Classification
This project specifically aims for building a predictive model which determines the various Grade of a house (A,B,C,D or E) based on various parameters and will help real estate agent and buyers both to make faster business decisions.

## Problem Statement
Grade indicates the quality and condition of a residence. This strongly influences the homes’ value. The Grade can also be used by existing owners to list their properties for sale. To facilitate different requirements of property buyers, real estate companies prefer categorizing various houses into different grades based on various parameters.

Build a predictive model to determine the Grade of houses (The grades are A,B,C,D, and E).

My Approach
Created few ML Models that include data visualisation and data preprocessing, and for model building and obtaining best performing model Accuracy, and F1 scores were used to determine the best model.

Naive Bayes, Decision tree Classifier, ensemble techniques like Random Forest Classifier and Stacking Classifier were the Supervised machine learning models used in this project. The best model obtained is the XGBoost Regressor.

Technologies Used
